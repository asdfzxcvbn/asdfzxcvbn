github gives you 6 pinned repos max. here's some cool (open source) stuff i've made:

- [pyzule](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule): an azule "clone" written in python3
- [quin](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/quin): quickly inject dylibs into an IPA without fully unzipping
- [appdupe](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/appdupe): a cli tool to duplicate iOS apps "correctly"
- [altSourceConverter](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/altSourceConverter): convert "esign-style" repos to AltSource format
- [zxUpdateNotifier](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/zxUpdateNotifier): an injectable tweak that notifies you of app updates; useful when sideloading
- [update-notifier](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/update-notifier): a telegram bot that will send updates to a channel whenever an update has been released for an app store app
- [repo-notifier](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/repo-notifier): sends a message to somewhere on telegram when a new app has been added to an altstore/esign/whatever repo
- [makeproj](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/makeproj): quickly make a theos project (with sane defaults)
- [DiscordNoTrack](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/DiscordNoTrack): blocks tracking on discord's iOS app
- [ESignNoTelemetry](https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/ESignNoTelemetry): a (garbage) tweak that blocks telemetry on esign
